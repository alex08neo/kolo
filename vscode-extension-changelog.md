# VSCode Extension Changelog

_Kolo consists of a python package and a VSCode extension. This is the changelog for the VSCode extension. To view the changelog of the Python package [go here](./python-package-changelog.md)_

_We recommend using the latest version of the kolo python package and VSCode extension. That way youâ€™ll run the most stable and feature-rich versions_

        And the button to "unselect" an invocation is now right next to the selected invocation

  - This automatic selecting can be disabled/enabled via the circular button at the top of the sidebar
